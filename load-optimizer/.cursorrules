# Cursor Rules for Load Optimizer Project

## Code Style
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Project Structure
- Main logic goes in `src/load_optimizer/`
- Tests go in `tests/` directory
- Data files go in `data/` directory
- Use Pydantic models for data validation

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all major functions
- Use pytest for testing
- Aim for high test coverage

## Documentation
- Update README.md when adding new features
- Include examples in docstrings
- Document all public APIs

## Dependencies
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Use type hints to reduce need for runtime checks
- Prefer standard library when possible
You are helping build a container load optimizer.

Coding standards:
- Python 3.11+
- Prefer pure functions and type hints everywhere
- Use pydantic for input validation schemas
- Keep algorithms in src/load_optimizer/packing/
- Keep geometry primitives in src/load_optimizer/geometry.py
- Write tests for every heuristic and constraint

Behavior:
- Before coding, restate the goal and assumptions in 3 bullets.
- When implementing a heuristic, also implement:
  (1) a deterministic seed option,
  (2) a quick benchmark function,
  (3) a pytest file with at least 3 cases.
- Never mix IO with core algorithm logic.
